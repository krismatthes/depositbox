# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Quick Deployment Steps

Your project is now restructured and ready for Vercel deployment.

### Method 1: Direct Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository or drag & drop this folder
5. Vercel will automatically detect it as a Next.js project
6. Click "Deploy"

### Method 2: Vercel CLI

```bash
npx vercel
```

Follow the prompts:
- Link to existing project? No
- Project name: depositums-box
- Directory: ./
- Override settings? No

### Project Structure ✅

The project has been restructured to work with Vercel:

```
/
├── package.json         ← Moved from apps/web/
├── next.config.js       ← Moved from apps/web/
├── vercel.json         ← Vercel configuration
├── src/                ← Moved from apps/web/src/
├── public/             ← Moved from apps/web/public/
└── ...
```

### Configuration Files

**vercel.json** - Already configured:
- Framework: Next.js
- Build command: npm run build
- Node version: 18

**next.config.js** - Production ready:
- TypeScript errors ignored for deployment
- ESLint errors ignored for deployment
- Environment variables configured

### Environment Variables

Set in Vercel dashboard:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = your API URL

### Expected Result

After deployment, your application should be available at:
`https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

### Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
3. Check Node.js version compatibility

The project is now ready for deployment! 🚀
